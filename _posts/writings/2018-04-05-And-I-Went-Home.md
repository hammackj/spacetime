<br>
Been taught to see good deeds, <br>
In those with a black heart, <br>
Been raised to care for worthy, <br>
To those who shall deserve, <br>
Had I been raised a voice against? <br>
Believed with mind and grasped with respect, <br>
The day I saw the cruelty of the night, <br>
I accepted it as an old friend.
<br>

Been told to walk together, <br>
With those who don't follow, <br>
Been served the best principles, <br>
With a vision for better future, <br>
Had I been tried to rush? <br>
Believed to love the journey through, <br>
The day I saw people running, <br>
I accepted it as an old friend. <br>

Been guided to treat humans well, <br>
To everyone whose heart still beats, <br>
Been taught to give love well, <br>
To those who don't ask for it, <br>
Had I tried to ask the reason? <br> 
Believed within the time second, <br>
The day I saw humans, <br>
Who take your time while they have a reason, <br>
Who find a way out when they've no reason, <br>
Who make soft faces while they have a reason, <br>
Who leaves you in silence when they've no reason, <br>
That day, I went home. <br>

Never shall I saw human faces; After I went home. <br>
Never shall I walked with; After I went home. <br>
Never shall I looked back; After I went home. <br>
Never shall I left the home, <br>
After I went home. <br>

<br>

And that day, I went home. <br>
