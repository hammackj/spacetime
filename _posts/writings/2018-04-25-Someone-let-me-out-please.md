One of the many important concepts Albert Camus thought and spread the word about is, the free nature of a man. He says that a person, even though feel like bounded with over-responsibilities of social or mental cause, is actaully free in his own fundamental. Our social world exists as much as a crucial factor for living a methodical life with us, parallel to it, it also creates an invisible container for our mental thoughts. We start to think and do things on the basis as we are not totally free, which is in fact a 'bad faith'.

> This poem is from the point of view of a pure soul living in a body. It is named as **'someone let me out please'**.

<br>
Surprised I am, to see how much it talks,  <br>
About people, habits and deceitful thoughts. <br>
Ruminate the filthy, produces the aroma, <br>
Knowingly living a life of trauma. <br>
Those little things, moving left to right, <br>
Searching the likes in this muck of light. <br>
Damn this walking body is dead inside, <br>
Who knows the pure where the evil resides. <br>
This healthy skeleton is spreading the disease, <br>
Someone let me out, please. <br>

<br>
Hear me, you, whom I can see through the eye, <br>
He thought of killing you, it's all a lie. <br>
I'm drowning in this filthy river of blood, <br>
It shall be remembered, even in this mud, <br>
Give me a dagger and let me end the breathing, <br>
I can't see the chest, up and down breezing, <br>
You shall be seeing a world so sweeten, <br>
When I'll be out with my coherent freedom, <br>
A shift of purity will be seen as a breeze, <br>
Someone let me out, please. <br>
