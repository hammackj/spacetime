One of the many concepts Albert Camus wrote about is the free nature of a man, he says that a person, even though feel like bounded with responsibilities of social or mental events, is actaully free in his own skin i.e. fundamental. Our social world exists with us, as much as a crucial factor for living a methodical life, parallel to it, it also creates an invisible container for our mental thoughts.

> This poem is from the point of view of a pure soul living in a body. It is named as **'someone let me out please'**.

<br>
Surprised I am, to see how much it talks,  <br>
About people, habits and deceitful thoughts. <br>
Ruminate the filthy, produces the aroma, <br>
Knowingly living a life of trauma. <br>
Those little things, moving left to right, <br>
Searching the likes in this muck of light. <br>
Damn this walking body is dead inside, <br>
Who knows the pure where the evil resides. <br>
This healthy skeleton is spreading the disease, <br>
Someone let me out, please. <br>

<br>
Hear me, you, whom I can see through the eye, <br>
He thought of killing you, it's all a lie. <br>
I'm drowning in this filthy river of blood, <br>
It shall be remembered, even in this mud, <br>
Give me a dagger and let me end the breathing, <br>
I can't see the chest, up and down breezing, <br>
You shall be seeing a world so sweeten, <br>
When I'll be out with my coherent freedom, <br>
A shift of purity will be seen as a breeze, <br>
Someone let me out, please. <br>
