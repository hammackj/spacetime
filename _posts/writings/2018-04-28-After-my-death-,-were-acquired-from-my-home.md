The weather has turned sad again but I am not sure, I was here a couple of hours ago. Oh, these nearly hundred years could be wrapped in some minutes of moments. The forensic team conversing with the cops and neighbour about the things that were discovered from my home, after my death; Oh! that concerned and upset neightbour. 

<br>

A few poetries on festered papers, <br>
Putrefied letters from a gorgeous, <br>
Rack of books under layers of dust, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
 <br>
A pair of wrinkled navy blue shirts, <br>
Blooded bandage lying around absurd, <br>
Recorded audio tapes crying unheard, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
 <br>
Cluttered blurred smiling photographs, <br>
Thriller posters from 60-ies old hits, <br>
Taped cuttings of some missed friends, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
 <br>
Half burnt cigars reclining in ash-tray, <br>
Cross marked calender on last wednesday, <br>
Unused travel-tickets of southern airway, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
 <br>
A large placard of my father' smile, <br>
Fallen acheivements around the pile, <br>
Rotten degrees coming outof the file, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
 <br>
Flowing fragrance of blue loneliness, <br>
Screaming voice of closed nothingness, <br>
Heeding ears of dumbstruck deaf walls, <br>
After my death, were acquired from my home. <br>
<br>
