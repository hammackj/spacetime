It's dusk again, I can see right from my half opened window. The intense red light is filled in my room, therein I can see the clouds, appearing greyish like they are filled with water, waiting to be poured down the sky as always, the curling wind is moving with the tender tree branches. I am laying at my bed, eyes wide open, probably ignoring the events going around and trying to look at the strong young nature with an infatuation stronger than ever. The passion about the thing I love is still firing slow in my beating heart, a friend is still sitting next door in his own world, I still find happiness in this little thought of pure mind that I thinkof. It's my mind taking care of itself in this caged environment, I feel like heaven down here. **All I need is a coffee, a metal music and a beloved to go into sleep or a beer, a rain and a thought to rise**. I can do both.

> Here is a rhythmic para to let the absurdist in me take me over, and a desire of cool glass of water to exist like a normal person.


<br>
Have seen the lovers, dissipated in each other's eyes. <br>
Have seen the tears, dripping down hard from the bones, <br>
Have seen the touch, scratching softly the empty flesh, <br>
O'Dear!, must have seen a lot of laceration, <br>
My eyelet dried up, wandering for that figure, <br>
Living the life with myself, anxious in my bed. <br>
But please o'please, don't dare to give me her love, <br>
**Just give a cool drink of water <br> 
and let me die slowly.** <br>
<br>
